## Dependencies
- Java 9+ (because Map.of is too nice to live without)
- llvm or at least lli
- libreadline (?) java is packaged but not sure if that includes the JNI extension

## Differences from upstream:

### Lexer
- allows escape characters
- allows numbers to start with a '.'
- disallows multi-line strings
- logs column as well as line number on error
- logs multiple illegal tokens in a row as a single error
- use 'null' instead of 'nil'
- use 'function' instead of 'fun'
- adds several operators:
    - unaries (PLUS_PLUS, MINUS_MINUS)
    - bitwise functions (PIPE, AMPERSAND, PERCENT, CARET)
    - enhanced assignment (PLUS_EQUAL, MINUS_EQUAL, STAR_EQUAL, SLASH_EQUAL, DOT_EQUAL, CARET_EQUAL, PERCENT_EQUAL, AMPERSAND_EQUAL)
